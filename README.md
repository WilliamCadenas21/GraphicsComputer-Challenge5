# 3D Object Visualization in Java

This Java program takes input from a coordinate file and creates a 3D object visualization in perspective for a 2D observer.

## Implementation

This Java program provides a simple way to create 3D object visualizations in perspective for a 2D observer, using algebraic equations given in class by the professor of Computer Grapichs. It can be used for a variety of applications, including gaming, visualization, and simulation.
